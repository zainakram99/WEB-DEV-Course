    <h3>CLS : Cumulative Layout Shift</h3>

    <video src="./cls_2.webm" controls width="500" height="548 "></video>

    <h4>What is CLS?</h4>
    <p>
      CLS is a measure of the largest burst of layout shift scores for every
      unexpected layout shift that occurs during the lifespan of a page. A
      layout shift occurs any time a visible element changes its position from
      one rendered frame to the next. See Layout shift score for details on how
      these shifts are measured. A burst of layout shifts, known as a session
      window, is when one or more individual layout shifts occur in rapid
      succession with less than 1 second between each shift, during a maximum
      period of 5 seconds. The largest burst is the session window with the
      maximum cumulative score of all layout shifts within that window.
    </p>
    <h4>What is a good CLS score?</h4>
    <p>
      To provide a good user experience, a site must have a CLS score of 0.1 or
      less. To ensure you're hitting this target for most of your users, we
      recommend measuring the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across
      mobile and desktop devices.

    <h3>LCP : Largest Contextual Paint</h3>
    <h4>What is LCP?</h4>
    <p>
      LCP reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible in
      the viewport, relative to when the user first navigated to the page
    </p>
    <h4>What is a good LCP score?</h4>
    <p>
      To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have LCP of 2.5
      seconds or less. To ensure you're hitting this target for most of your
      users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads,
      segmented across mobile and desktop devices.

    <h3>FID : First Input Delay</h3>
    <h4>What is FID?</h4>
    <p>
      FID measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page (that
      is, when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom,
      JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser is actually able
      to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction
    </p>
    <h4>What is a good FID score?</h4>
    <p>
      To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have a First
      Input Delay of 100 milliseconds or less. To ensure you're hitting this
      target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th
      percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices.
